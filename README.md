Problem: calculate all prime numbers from 1 to 10^8 while using 8 concurrent threads to speed up the total execution time.

For this Assignment, I decided to use Java since I am most familiar with this language and have used some of its concurrent programming features before. 

To break the work of calculating primes into different threads, I created a class called "CalcPrimesThread" that extends the base class Thread. This class I created has a constructor that takes start and end parameter numbers to define the range of numbers that the thread will be checking primes for. The constructor also recieves an ArrayList called "primeList" which it holds onto as a class memeber to store all the primes it finds during the thread's execution. Finally, each "CalcPrimesThread" also receives the same ArrayList "sumList" so that each thread can add the total number of primes it found to this list. This ArrayList should have 8 total numbers, one from each thread, after all threads finish execution, and these 8 numbers can be added together in the end to find out the total primes found from 1 to 10^8 across all 8 threads.

The "CalcPrimeThreads" class has a public function called run that is called once the thread is started. In this run function, there is a for loop that iterates through each number from "start" to "end" (inclusive) and determines whether each of these numbers is prime using a helper function called "isPrime". Each prime number found is added to the "primeList" ArrayList that was passed into the thread class and added to a running sum of all the primes found in the thread. Additionally, the helper function "isPrime" is optimized to return false immediately for any even number. Then the helper function iterates through all odd numbers from 3 up to the square root of the number that it is checking primality for. These modifications help to speed up prime checks for each number since even numbers are ruled out immediately, and there is no reason to check for divisiblity above the square root of a number.

Finally, in the main function of public class "Primes", the range of 1 to 10^8 is split up into 8 sub-ranges and passed to 8 seperate "CalcPrimesThread" objects to split up the work. Additionally, a list of 8 ArrayLists is generated in main with each ArrayList being passed to a seperate thread so that the thread can add al the prime numbers it finds to. A shared ArrayList called "sumPrimesList" is also passed to each thread so that each thread can add how many total primes it finds in. Once all thread objects are created, a seperate function starts are thread objects simultaneously and calls ".join()" on each thread right after to make the program wait until all threads finish execution. After all threads finish execution the elapsed time for the threads to execute is calculated, the total number of primes found by each thread are summed up, the sum of all primes found in each thread are summed up, and the top 10 maximum primes found accross all threads is determined. All of these results are the output to the file "primes.txt". 

Ultimately, this concurrent design of the program splits up all 10^8 numbers being checked equally across all threads to drastically improve total execution time of the program. The average execution time for this programs is around 3.5 seconds on my Mac and around 7 seconds when I ran it on my desktop. This is very reasonable compared to the stalling of my command line when I tried sequentially finding all primes from 1 to 10^8. 

To run this program: 
    1. Use the command prompt to navigate to the directort where the Primes.java files is located.
    2. Enter the command "javac Primes.java" on the command line to compile the java source code.
    3. Enter the command "java Primes" on the command line to execute the code.
    4. Open the primes.txt file generated by the program's execution. This text file contains all the required output for the program and is placed in the same directory as the "Primes.java" file.
